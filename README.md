**This Python script allows to pre-install any Python** *pip* (*PyPI*) (*Python Package Index*)- **Packages within a final *Yocto Project* Linux Image.** 

In order to make this possible a Bitbake-file with all necessary information's (Version Number, Checksums,..) will be generated
to allow Bitbake to include the chosen pip-package to the *rootfs* of the generated Yocto-Project Linux Distribution. 

I developed this Python script to create [*rsYocto*](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto) an embedded Linux for *Intel SoC-FPGAs*. 

## Features

* **Python script to automatically create Bitbake recipe files for the Yocto Project to pre-install any Python *pip* package**
* **Almost every Python pip package can implemented into a custom Linux Distribution**
    * Of cause, it is only necessary that the package is as a cross Platform version available 
* **Outputs a *".bb"*-Bitbake recipe file that can easily included to any Yocto Project *meta-layer***
* **Supported *Python Package Index Version***: 1-3
* **Supported Python pip package archive file types:** "*.tar.gz*" and "*.zip*"
* **It is enabled to use URL/Link to a specific Python package version or to a custom Server**


# Guide to use this script
1.  Pull this repository to your Yocto Project building machine
2.  Be sure that **Python pip 3** is installed on your development machine 
    * To install that use on **Ubuntu**:
         ```bash
         sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
        ````
    * To install that use on **CentOS**:
         ```bash
         sudo yum install python-pip
        ````
3. Start the python script
    ```bash
     python3 makePipRecipes.py
    ````
4. **Find a Python [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)-package to include to the Yocto Project**
5. **Follow the instruction of the Python script**
    * The script will ask for:
        1. The **pip-package** name (e.g. by `pip install pyserial` use "`pyserial`")
            * Be sure that the uppercase/lowercase of the string is exact (**Case sensitive!**)
            * **Alternatively here it is enabled to insert a URL/Link to the package**
                * Use the entire Link with the "*http*"- or "*https*"- pre-fix and with the file suffix
                * You can find the URLs to the package inside the *"Download files"* selection of the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) package website
                * For instance "*pyserial*" it would be: "*https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/1e/7d/ae3f0a63f41e4d2f6cb66a5b57197850f919f59e558159a4dd3a818f5082/pyserial-3.5.tar.gz*"
                * **Note:** "*.whl*" archive packages are not supported! 

        2. For the required **Python-Version**
        3. For the **Type of Licence** (e.g. MIT) for recipe
7. **The Python script will generate a *".bb"*-Bitbake-file**
    * **Copy** this file to your recipe folder
    * If you don't have a *meta-layer* create a new one
        * Execute following command inside your Yocto Project build Folder (`poky/build`)
            ```bash 
            bitbake-layers create-layer meta-example
            ````
        * Include the new layer to your Yocto Project by **adding following line** to the `poky/build/conf/bblayers.conf`-file:
            ````txt 
            /home/<user name>/poky/meta-example \
            ````
     * **Copy** the generated recipe file to your recipes:
       ```txt 
          meta-example
          |- conf
          | - README
          |- recipes-test
             |- test
                |-GENERATED_BITBAKAE_FILE.bb
       ```
8. **Include the Python pip package to your Yocto Build by adding following line to the `poky/build/conf/local.conf`-file**
    ```txt 
    IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "pip-PIPNAME"
    ````
9. **To execute the implementation start the building process of the Yocto Project normally**
   * For example with (*inside `poky/build`*): 
      ```bash 
      bitbake core-image-minimal
      ````

* *rsyocto*; **Robin Sebastian,M.Sc. [(LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-sebastian-a5080220a)**

*Pip2BitBake* and *rsyocto* are self-developed projects in which no other companies are involved. 
It is specifically designed to serve students and the Linux/FPGA open-source community with its publication on GitHub and its open-source MIT license. 
In the future, *rsyocto* will retain its open-source status and it will be further developed. 

Due to the enthusiasm of commercial users, special features for industrial, scientific and automotive applications 
were developed and ready for the implementation in a highly optimazed closed commercial version. 
Partnerships as an embedded SoC-FPGA design service to fulfil these specific commercial requirements are offered. 
It should help, besides students with the *rsyocto* open-source version, commercial users, as well.
